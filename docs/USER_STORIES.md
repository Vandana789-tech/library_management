# User Stories – Library Book Management System

## Sprint 1 – Book Registration

**US-1:** As a librarian, I want to add a new book with Book ID, title, and author so that the book can be stored in the library system.

**US-2:** As a librarian, I want the system to reject duplicate Book IDs so that each book is uniquely identified.

## Sprint 2 – Borrow and Return Books

**US-3:** As a user, I want to borrow a book so that I can read it.

**US-4:** As a librarian, I want the system to prevent borrowing of an already borrowed book so that book availability is correctly maintained.

**US-5:** As a user, I want to return a borrowed book so that it becomes available for others.

## Sprint 3 – Library Report

**US-6:** As a librarian, I want to generate a library report showing book ID, title, author, and status so that I can view the current state of the library.
